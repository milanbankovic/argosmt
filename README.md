## Overview

ArgoSMT is an experimental SMT solver developed for research
purposes. The author of the solver is [Milan
BankoviÄ‡](http:/www.matf.bg.ac.rs/~milan/), a member of [ARGO
Group](http://argo.matf.bg.ac.rs/). The solver is released under the
[GNU GPL licence](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).

The solver currently supports EUF, LRA and LIA theories, as well as
their combinations. Other theory solvers are also planned to be
included in the future.

**IMPORTANT:** An experimental support for trail saving (as described
by [Hickey &
Bacchus](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-51825-7_4))
is available within [ts](https://github.com/milanbankovic/argosmt/tree/ts) branch of this project. Please, consult the
version of README.md document within [ts](https://github.com/milanbankovic/argosmt/tree/ts) branch for further details.

## How to use

To use the solver, it is best to run it in the following way:

	./src/argosmt input_file.smt2
      

The solver accepts inputs in [SMT-LIB
2.0](https://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/) format (for supported theories,
only).

Option `-h` provides you with more information about the supported options.
